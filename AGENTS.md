# Instructions

Start each markdown document with a detailed description of the topic and its terms.  
Each text line should be around 80 letters max for better readability.  

Do not user numeric sections.  

## Code instructions

- Do not use Python type hints
- Use modern Python 3.14

A sample of a good section:

Short description 

```python
print('hello there')
```

longer description of code. 


Finish each document with a bulleted summary.
